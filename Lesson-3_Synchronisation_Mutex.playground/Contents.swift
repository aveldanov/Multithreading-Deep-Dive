// LESSON 3 - Synchronisation & Mutex

// When READ and WRITE happening at the same time
// If not syncrinized - broken data


/*
 
 Mutex â€” ensures that only one thread is active in a given region of code at a time. You can think of it as a semaphore with a maximum count of 1.
 
 Mutex is blocking and releasing objects
 
 when the object is Mutex protected - the thread pinging it is in WAIT mode until Mutex is released
