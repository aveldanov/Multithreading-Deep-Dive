// LESSON 4 - NSRecursiveLock & Mutex Recursive lock
/*
 
 Concurrency Problems:
 
 Race Conditions – Occurs when processes that must occur in a particular order occur out of order due to multiple threading.
 
 Deadlock – Occurs when two competing processes are waiting for each other to finish, allowing neither to finish.

 Starvation – Occurs when a process never gains accesses to resources, never allowing the program to finish.

 Livelock – Occurs when two threads are dependent on each other signals and are both threads respond to each others signals. If this is the case, the threads can cause a loop similar to something between a deadlock and starvation.
 
 Priority inversion - Technically speaking, priority inversion occurs when a queue with a lower quality of service is given higher system priority than a queue with a higher quality of service, or QoS.
